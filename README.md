# Airport-Locator


- I have create an MVC Application that will allow a User to perform the following:

1. Search for airports within a user-specified distance of a single zipcode.
2. Specify a city name and display all zipcodes within the specified city.
3. Extra Credit - Specify a city name and display all airport codes that are within a user-specified distance of the city.
Note - To calculate nearby airports, you should first find all zipcodes within the city.  Then, for each zipcode, find airports that are within the specified radius.  If an airport is within the specified radius of any zipcode in the city, it should be reported in the results.
4. Allow a User to search for cities phonetically.
5. For each airport that is displayed in a search result, also display a static map with a thumbnail at the location of the airport
6. For each zipcode that is displayed in a search result, display a static map with a thumbnail at the location of the zipcode
